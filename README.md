# House-Price-Prediction
Problem:
#It is desired to carry out a machine learning project on the prices of different types of houses, using the data set containing the features and house prices of each house.

Story of Dataset
#This dataset of residential homes in Lowa, Ames contains 79 explanatory variables. 
You can access the dataset and competition page of the project, which also has a competition on Kaggle, from the link below. 
Since the dataset belongs to a kaggle competition, there are two different csv files, train and test. 
House prices are left blank in the test dataset, and you are expected to estimate these values.
